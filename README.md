# Zipties - for MC 1.12.2

I'm working on completing the Zipties plugin made by [Mishyy](https://github.com/Mishyy/Zipties)\
*(Mitch wrote the large majority of the code, I simply finished what he started.)*\
A pre-compiled build is available to you on the releases tab, or you can build it yourself with gradle.

## Crafting!
Can be turned off or on in config.yml

## Permissions
* zipties.use - use zipties
* zipties.bypass - blocks you from getting ziptied
* zipties.admin - allows you to use /zipties release <player>, /zipties zipties, and /zipties cutters

### Other things you should know
* Everybody can release others using cutters.
* Everybody can escape zipties by tapping SNEAK button while tied up. (It's a very small chance of success though)
* Prisoners are given Weakness when they're tied and removed of weakness when they are released.
