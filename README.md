# Zipties

See a demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z53n6VGf5Ts).
This is a modified version of [Mishyy's](https://github.com/Mishyy) Zipties plugin. (Adds more functionality, etc)

## Usage
### Crafting
Can be turned on or off in [config.yml](https://github.com/celerry/Zipties/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml)

![Crafting Recipes](https://github.com/celerry/Zipties/blob/master/assets/crafting.png?raw=true "Crafting recipes")
### Permissions
* zipties.use - use zipties --- permission requirement can be toggled in config.yml to allow everyone to use, no matter what.
* zipties.bypass - blocks you from getting ziptied
* zipties.admin - allows you to use /zipties release, /zipties zipties, and /zipties cutters

### Other things you should know
* Everybody can release others using cutters.
* Everybody can escape zipties by tapping SNEAK button while tied up. (It's a very small chance of success though)
* Prisoners are given Weakness when they're tied and removed of weakness when they are released.
* You can only restrain 1 person at a time.
* You can leave people on the floor by shift and right clicking them while holding an item, and pick them back up by shift and right clicking again!
