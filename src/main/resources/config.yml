# Permission Nodes
#
# zipties.use - use zipties & /zipties release to release your current prisoner
# zipties.bypass - blocks you from getting ziptied
# zipties.admin - allows you to use /zipties release <player>
# Everybody can release using cutters.
#

# SEMI-IMPORTANT:
# Don't try and use %placeholders% unless they're already written in the config message on default or it won't work. %prefix% works anywhere though.
